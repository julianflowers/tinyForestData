#' Urban-rural classifiction for each Tiny Forest location
#'
#'Each Tiny Forest was assigned to an ONS urban-rural classification by mapping the location to
#'a lower super output area (LSOA) and matching to the LSOA urban-rural classification database provided by ONS. 
#'For English TFs the 10 fold classification system was used. Scotland has a slightly different system with 8 classes
